<h2>types of operating systems:</h2>

<h2>Multiprogramming Batch Systems:</h2>
In this the operating system picks up and begins to execute one of the jobs from memory.
Once this job needs an I/O operation operating system switches to another job (CPU and OS always busy).
Jobs in the memory are always less than the number of jobs on disk(Job Pool).
If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, then the system chooses which one to run through the process of CPU Scheduling.
In Non-multiprogrammed system, there are moments when CPU sits idle and does not do any work.
In Multiprogramming system, CPU will never be idle and keeps on processing.

<h2>Desktop Systems:</h2>
Earlier, CPUs and PCs lacked the features needed to protect an operating system from user programs. PC operating systems therefore were neither multiuser nor multitasking. However, the goals of these operating systems have changed with time; instead of maximizing CPU and peripheral utilization, the systems opt for maximizing user convenience and responsiveness. These systems are called Desktop Systems and include PCs running Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh. Operating systems for these computers have benefited in several ways from the development of operating systems for mainframes.

Microcomputers were immediately able to adopt some of the technology developed for larger operating systems. On the other hand, the hardware costs for microcomputers are sufficiently low that individuals have sole use of the computer, and CPU utilization is no longer a prime concern. Thus, some of the design decisions made in operating systems for mainframes may not be appropriate for smaller systems.

<h2>Distributed Operating System:</h2>
The motivation behind developing distributed operating systems is the availability of powerful and inexpensive microprocessors and advances in communication technology.

These advancements in technology have made it possible to design and develop distributed systems comprising of many computers that are inter connected by communication networks. The main benefit of distributed systems is its low price/performance ratio.
